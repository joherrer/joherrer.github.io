  overview: >
    CashCards is a RESTful API built with Java and Spring Boot for managing cash cards. 
    The application provides full CRUD functionality, stores data in a PostgreSQL database, 
    and uses Spring Security for authentication and authorization to ensure secure and reliable management.
  challenge: >
    Build a robust API that allows secure management of cash cards, supports user authentication 
    with role-based access control, and ensures reliable data storage and integrity across all operations.
  solution: >
    I developed a Spring Boot API to manage cash cards with full CRUD functionality, using Spring Security 
    for user authentication and authorization. I implemented a PostgreSQL database with JPA/Hibernate and Flyway, 
    and ensured reliability through unit and integration tests using JUnit with an in-memory H2 database.
