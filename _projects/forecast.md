  overview: >
    Gold Coast Surf Forecast is a web application built with Python and Flask that fetches 
    real-time surf data from an external API. User accounts and favorite surf spots are stored 
    in a SQL database. The app features a clean, responsive interface optimized for desktop, 
    tablet, and mobile devices.
  challenge: >
    Create a web application that retrieves real-time surf data from an external API in a 
    user-friendly format, supports user accounts and session management, and remains fully 
    responsive across all devices.
  solution: >
    I developed a Python and Flask backend that fetches data from the Surfline API, manages user 
    accounts with Werkzeug and Flask-Session, and stores data in a SQLite database via SQLAlchemy. 
    I also built a clean, responsive frontend with HTML, CSS, and Jinja, optimized for desktop,
    tablet, and mobile devices.
