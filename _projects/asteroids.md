  overview: >
    Asteroids is a desktop application built with Java and JavaFX that recreates the classic arcade game Asteroids.
    The game features smooth animations with responsive controls, and a self-contained macOS installer that allows 
    users to download and run it like a native app.
  challenge: >
    Create a desktop game that delivers fast-paced, classic arcade-style gameplay, handles real-time animations and collisions, 
    and runs as a standalone macOS application without requiring users to install Java or JavaFX.
  solution: >
    I developed a desktop application using Java and JavaFX, structuring entities like spaceship, asteroids, 
    and projectiles following object-oriented programming principles. I used JavaFX's AnimationTimer for real-time updates, 
    rendering, and collision detection, and bundled the game as a self-contained macOS installer with JLink and JPackage 
    for a seamless native experience.
